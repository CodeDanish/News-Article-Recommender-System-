## 🔍 Project Overview

The **News & Article Recommender System** is designed to provide personalized news and article recommendations to users based on their reading preferences, history, and trends. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to suggest relevant content and improve user engagement.

🎯 **Objective**: 
To recommend news articles tailored to each user's interests, leveraging NLP techniques and collaborative filtering.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests articles based on individual user behavior and preferences.
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Continuously updates and refines recommendations.
- **NLP-Powered**: Extracts key topics, trends, and sentiments to provide contextually relevant articles.
- **Multi-Category Support**: Recommends across a variety of categories such as tech, sports, politics, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for text analysis.
- **Collaborative Filtering** for personalized suggestions.
- **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **Numpy** for machine learning and data manipulation.
- **Streamlit** for the web interface.

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd news-article-recommender
   ```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Cleaning and preprocessing of article metadata and text.
- Tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF) of article content.

### 2. Feature Engineering 🛠️
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends articles similar to those a user has already read, using text similarities.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends based on the preferences of similar users (user-item interactions).
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation 🤖
The system evaluates several algorithms, including:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for collaborative filtering.
- **Cosine Similarity** for content-based recommendations.
- **Matrix Factorization** (SVD) for collaborative filtering refinement.

### 4. Running the Web App (Optional)

If you've developed a web interface for the recommender system, you can run the Flask app:

```bash

Copy code

set FLASK_APP=app.py

set FLASK_ENV=development

flask run
```
Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.
