News & Article Recommender System


Overview:

The News & Article Recommender System is a content-based recommendation engine that suggests news articles to users based on their interests. The system analyzes the content of articles and user preferences to provide personalized recommendations.

Features:

- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends articles by analyzing the textual content and matching it with user preferences.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts the text content of articles into numerical vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method.
- Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between articles to find the most relevant ones for the user.
- User Profiles: Builds profiles for users based on the articles they have interacted with.
- Dynamic Recommendations: Updates recommendations as new articles are added or user preferences change.


Installation:

- Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
- Clone the Repository
  
bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-article-recommender.git

cd news-article-recommender

Create a Virtual Environment:

bash

Copy code

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

bash

Copy code

Usage:

1. Preprocessing Data
   
To preprocess the data, ensure your dataset is in a CSV file with columns for article titles, content, and other relevant information. You can customize the preprocessing step in the preprocess.py script.

2. Training the Model
   
Run the following command to vectorize the articles and calculate similarity:

bash

Copy code

python train.py

This will generate a matrix of similarity scores that the system will use to recommend articles.

3. Making Recommendations
   
To generate recommendations for a user, run:

bash

Copy code

python recommend.py --user_id <user_id>

Replace <user_id> with the ID of the user for whom you want to generate recommendations.

4. Running the Web App (Optional)

If you've developed a web interface for the recommender system, you can run the Flask app:

bash

Copy code

set FLASK_APP=app.py

set FLASK_ENV=development

flask run

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

               
Data:

The recommender system requires a dataset of news articles. Each article should have at least the following columns:

- title: The title of the article.
- content: The full text content of the article.
- category: (Optional) The category or genre of the article.
- author: (Optional) The author of the article.
